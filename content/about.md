## Welcome

Welcome to Sothis Therapeutic Massage. I'm Nancy Raza, a licensed massage therapist dedicated to helping you restore balance, heal, and reconnect with your body through therapeutic massage and holistic wellness.

## The Meaning of Sothis

In Ancient Greek, **Σῶθις (Sōthis)** refers to the star ⭐ **Sirius**, which the Greeks identified with the Egyptian goddess Sopdet. The goddess Sopdet was associated with fertility, rebirth, the flooding of the Nile, and the start of a new year—a symbol of renewal and new beginnings.

The rising of Sirius was especially significant because it marked the beginning of the Nile's annual inundation, the natural cycle on which all Egyptian agriculture and life depended.

Inspired by this symbolism, **Sothis Massage embodies renewal, balance, and the flow of energy** ✨, supporting your journey toward wellness, healing, and a fresh beginning in your body and mind. 🧘

## My Approach

I believe that massage goes beyond just relaxing you—it's a vital part of maintaining your physical and mental well-being. My approach is client-centered, meaning each session is tailored to your specific needs and goals. Whether you're seeking relief from chronic pain, recovering from an injury, or simply looking to relax and restore, I'm here to support your healing journey.

I strive to create a safe, calming environment where you can disconnect from the stress of daily life and reconnect with your body.
