## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is massage painful?
It's not unusual to feel some soreness after a massage. This is due to a release of lactic acid in the muscles, but it doesn't last long. You may also have some discomfort during your massage. This depends on the area we're working on, any pre-existing pains, and whether the therapist is using too much pressure. You can always ask the therapist to use less pressure at any time if it’s too uncomfortable.

### Do I have to take my clothes off?
No! All our therapists will ask you to remove clothing only as far as you feel comfortable. If you only want to undress to your underwear, that's fine. The therapist will leave the room while you're undressing and will provide towels and blankets to cover you during the massage. There are some massages that work well if you want to remain clothed, so discuss this with us before you book.

### I’m self-conscious about my weight, hair, scars, or potential acne. What should I do?
Please don't let this stop you from getting help from a massage therapist. If you're sensitive about a particular area, ask them to avoid it. You can also opt for a fully clothed massage. Whatever your concerns, know that your therapists are friendly, supportive and judgment-free.

### Should I see a Massage Therapist if I’m not in pain?
Massage therapy is a great natural solution when you want relief from pain, but it can also be used as a preventive treatment too. Seeing your massage therapist regularly can help lower cortisol and raise serotonin levels to calm and relax your body, and loosen tight muscles/increase blood flow.
We offer many modalities including Swedish Massage, Neuromuscular Therapy, Connective Tissue Therapy, Deep Tissue Therapy, Joint Mobilization, or Stone Therapy.

### What if I fall asleep and drool or snore?
It's normal to fall asleep during a massage. You might be feeling stressed and sleep-deprived, so falling asleep is normal once you're in a relaxed state. There's zero judgment from us if you snore. Drooling is also common, especially if you're on your front. Ask us for a tissue, and we'll be glad to grab one for you.

### What can I expect at my first massage?
When you arrive, we'll discuss your reasons for coming in, current physical condition, medical history, lifestyle, stress levels, and specific areas of pain.
Expect a peaceful, comfortable environment with relaxed lighting and soft music. You will be asked to undress in private to your comfort level (underwear on or off) and drape yourself with the provided sheet or towel on the padded table. Only the part of the body being worked on will be uncovered, fully respecting your modesty.
I will enter the room and may gently establish a connection, such as breathing in rhythm with you, before beginning the session.

### Isn't massage just to help you to relax?
Massage is excellent for relaxation! But it also has many other benefits. It helps with chronic muscle aches and pains, reduces stress, eases muscle tension, improves circulation, alleviates breathing problems, lowers blood pressure, reduces headaches, improves mobility, and helps manage anxiety and depression. Massage also helps to promote good, healthy sleep.

### Is it okay to ask for more or less pressure?
Yes! A good massage therapist will check in with you during your massage to make sure the pressure is okay. Be mindful that massage doesn't have to cause you pain to be effective. Some massage techniques are pretty gentle. But do speak up and ask your therapist if you'd like more or less pressure during your session. We won't be offended!

### What if I need the bathroom?
We recommend going to the bathroom before your session, but it can occasionally happen that you'll need to go during the massage. We want you to be relaxed, so if you're focusing on holding it in, it’ll interfere with your experience. So do speak up, and we'll let you know where the bathroom is.

### What if I pass gas during a massage?
When you're in a relaxed state, you might pass gas during your massage. Any massage therapist will let you know this is normal and just shows you're relaxed. You'll get zero judgment from your therapist. If you can't bear to let it happen, just excuse yourself to go to the bathroom.

### Should I talk to the therapist during my massage?
Some people prefer to chat during their massage session but don't feel you have to make conversation. If you want to close your eyes and relax, that’s alright. Do speak up if you're feeling hot or cold, in pain, or have questions.

### What happens if I'm ticklish?
Let your massage therapist know before your session. They can use firm, slow pressure or, if you're extremely sensitive, they can avoid your tickle spots.

### How can I be sure a massage clinic is reputable?
Do your research. A reputable clinic will offer therapeutic massage from licensed or certified therapists. They'll also always get you to do a health questionnaire on your first visit.

### Is it good to get massage on a regular basis?
"Massage has its greatest benefits over time and most doctors and therapists say the more often you get a massage, the better you feel," (New York Times). The therapeutic effects of massage are cumulative. From one session to the next, you are able to relax more and more as the chronic patterns of stress in the body are released. These changes are readily felt in your day-to-day life as well.

### Are There Any Side Effects?
Mild soreness or fatigue may occur after a massage, especially if deep tissue techniques are used. These effects are usually temporary and can be reduced by drinking water and resting. Serious side effects are rare, but patients should inform our therapist of any medical conditions or injuries.

### I ARRIVED WITH A LOT OF PAIN, BUT AFTER THE MASSAGE, THE PAIN IS STILL THERE?
While massage therapy will assist with pain relief, it may take several hours after your massage for the pain relief effects to kick-in. Additional sessions may be needed to reduce pain for chronic conditions. When you join a gym and want to get into shape, you don't expect to reach your goal with a single workout.
Massage therapy, when applied correctly, may require more than one session to achieve your pain relief goals. If you are suffering from an injury or condition beyond the scope of massage therapy, we will refer you to someone who can best help you.

### What is Trigger Point Therapy?
It is a specialized massage technique that targets painful, tight knots in muscles called "trigger points," applying sustained pressure with fingers or tools to release tension, improve circulation, and restore normal muscle function, relieving both local pain and referred pain (pain felt elsewhere). It's effective for chronic muscle tightness, headaches, and reduced mobility, often used by physiotherapists, massage therapists, and chiropractors.

### What is Deep Tissue Therapeutic Massage?
It targets deep layers of muscle and connective tissue using slow strokes and intense pressure to release chronic pain, stiffness, and muscle knots (adhesions) by breaking down scar tissue and improving circulation, making it ideal for postural issues, injury recovery, and chronic tension, though it involves more intense pressure than Swedish massage.

### What does Sothis mean?
Sothis is associated with the goddess Sopdet, who was associated with fertility, rebirth, the flooding of the Nile, and the start of a new year—a symbol of renewal and new beginnings. Inspired by this symbolism, Sothis Massage embodies renewal, balance, and the flow of energy, supporting your journey toward wellness, healing, and a fresh beginning in your body and mind.
